/*======================================================================================================
Design a program that computes the roots of a quadratic equations with one unknown: 
                                    ax^2+bx+c=0
The user inputs are the coefficients of the equation: a, b, and c. The program needs 
to give the root or roots of the equation based on the value of b^2 â€“ 4ac.
